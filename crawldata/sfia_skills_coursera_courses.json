In the past, if employees had an idea for automating or streamlining a business process, they often had to request that IT resources build the application. Today, it is much more common for employees themselves to become what is sometimes called \"citizen developers,\" who are people with business knowledge who can use app-building tools to create custom business apps. This course introduces building low-code/no-code apps with Microsoft® Power Apps®.Most out-of-the-box solutions do not meet exact business needs or integrate well with existing business apps. Power Apps eases users into app development with templates, automated app-building tools, and a streamlined programming language to enable any business user to create a custom app.\n\nThis course is designed for skilled users of Microsoft Windows® and Office who do not have prior coding or programming experience and who are interested in creating custom business apps quickly and without writing application code.\n\nIn this course, you will: determine how Microsoft Power Apps can meet your business needs, plan and design apps, build canvas apps, build model-driven apps, and test and deploy apps.\n\nThis course requires that you have access to a Microsoft 365 domain with a Power Apps Developer license.

          "description": "Artificial Intelligence: Ethics & Societal Challenges is a four-week course that explores ethical and societal aspects of the increasing use of artificial intelligent technologies (AI). The aim of the course is to raise awareness of ethical and societal aspects of AI and to stimulate reflection and discussion upon implications of the use of AI in society.The course consists of four modules where each module represents about one week of part-time studies. A module includes a number of lectures and readings. Each lesson finishes with a mandatory assignment in which you write a short sum-up of the most important new knowledge/insight you gained from this lesson, and review a lesson sum-up written by another student/participant. The assessments are intended to encourage learning and to stimulate reflection on ethical and societal issues of the use of AI in society. Participating in forum discussions is voluntary but strongly encouraged.\n\nIn the first module, we will discuss algorithmic bias and surveillance. Is it really true that algorithms are purely logical and free from human biases or are they maybe just as biased as we are, and if they are, why is that and what can we do about it? AI in many ways makes surveillance more effective, but what does it mean to us if we are increasingly being watched in more and more sophisticated ways? \n\nNext, we will talk about the impact of AI on democracy. We discuss why democracy is important, and how AI could hamper public democratic discussion, but also how it can help improve democracy. We will for instance talk about how social media could play in the hands of authoritarian regimes and present some ideas on how to make use of AI tools to develop the functioning of democracy.\n\nA further ethical question concerns whether our treatment of AI could matter for the AIs themselves. Can artefacts be conscious? What do we even mean by “conscious”? What is the relationship between consciousness and intelligence? This is the topic of the third week of the course. \n\nIn the last module we will talk about responsibility and control. If an autonomous car hits an autonomous robot, who is responsible? And who is responsible to make sure AI is developed in a safe and democratic way? \n\nThe last question of the course, and maybe also the ultimate question for our species, is how to control machines that are more intelligent than we are. Our intelligence has given us a lot of power over the world we live in. Shall we really give that power away to machines and if we do, how do we stay in charge?\n\nAt the end of the course, you will have \n·      a basic understanding of the AI bias phenomenon and the role of AI in surveillance, \n·      a basic understanding of the importance of democracy in relation to AI and acquaintance with common issues with democracy in relation to AI, \n·      an understanding of the complexity of the concepts ‘intelligence’ and ‘consciousness’ and acquaintance with common approaches to creating artificial consciousness, \n·      a basic understanding of the concepts of ‘forward-looking’ and ‘backward-looking responsibility’ and an acquaintance with problems connected to applying these concepts on AI, \n·      a basic understanding of the control problem in AI and acquaintance with commonly discussed solutions to this problem, \n·      and an ability to discuss and reflect upon the ethical and societal aspects of these issues.",

Next, it demonstrates the application of the security market line and sharpe optimal portfolio in the exercises. The second module involves the difficulties in implementing Mean-Variance techniques in a real-world setting and the potential methods to deal with it. We will introduce Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) as risk measurements, and Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), which play an important role in trading and asset management. Typical statistical biases, pitfalls, and their underlying reasons are also discussed, in order to achieve better results when completing  real statistical estimation. The final module looks directly at real-world transaction costs modeling. It includes the basic market micro-structures including order book, bid-ask spread, measurement of liquidity, and their effects on transaction costs. Then we enrich Mean-Variance portfolio strategies by considering transaction costs.",

The course offers a brand workout for your own brands, as well as guest videos from leading branding professionals.The aim of the course is to change the conception of brands as being an organisation's visual identity (e.g., logo) and image (customers' brand associations) to an experience along \"moments-that-matter\" along the customer journey and, therefore, delivered by people across the entire organisation. Brands are thus not only an external promise to customers, but a means of executing business strategy via internal brand-led behaviour and culture change.\n\nYou will learn and practice the following skills:\n\n1.\tHow to build brands from a broad organisational perspective \n2.\tHow to lead brand-led culture change with human resource practices at the core (i.e., brand as a lever and not just an outcome) \n3.\tHow to build brands in multi-brand companies, across cultures and geographies\n4.\tHow to measure brand health in new ways, that is, internally in addition to externally\n5.\tHow to value and capture returns to brands across the organisation - introducing the new concept of employee-based brand equity - and how this is different from the valuation of brands as intangible assets. \n\nThis course allows you to develop the following aspects of yourself:\n\n1.\tHead. Gain a deeper understanding of the evolving practice of brand management, one that goes further than practiced in most organisations today\n2.\tHeart. Be motivated to engage in delivering your own brands – regardless of where you are in your organisation – thereby creating superior value for customers and for your organisation\n3.\tHands. Translate learnings into action. As Confucius is supposed to have said: “I hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand.”",

          "description": "For many new or intermediate database developers, it’s difficult to know where to start when designing a relational database. It’s easy to make the mistake of assuming that the functionality of a database will take shape over time, or the design will fall into place as you build the database.This course introduces a process for effectively planning and designing a functional, efficient database. Knowing how to plan a relational database is important to the success of the databases you create. Without planning, you cannot possibly know what the database needs to do, or even what information to include in the database. Planning a database is essential and prevents the extra work of fixing data maintenance problems later on.\n\nThe concepts are not specific to a particular software application and can be applied to any relational database management system.\n\nThis course is designed for students who need to learn database design essentials, typically in preparation for, or as a supplement to, a course on SQL such as Logical Operations' SQL Querying: Fundamentals and courses on specific relational database platforms.\n\nIn this course, you will: follow an efficient process for designing a relational database; define the database conceptual model; define the database logical model; apply database normalization methods to improve the initial design of a database; and complete the database design, including controls to ensure its referential integrity and data integrity.",

          "description": "In an age now driven by \"big data\", we need to cut through the noise and present key information in a way that can be quickly consumed and acted upon making data visualization an increasingly important skill. Visualizations need to not only present data in an easy to understand and attractive way, but they must also provide context for the data, tell a story, achieving that fine balance between form and function. Excel has many rivals in this space, but it is still an excellent choice, particularly if it's where your data resides. It offers a wealth of tools for creating visualizations other than charts and the chart options available are constantly increasing and improving, so the newer versions now include waterfall charts, sunburst diagrams and even map charts. But what sets Excel apart is its flexibility, it gives us total creative control over our designs so if needed we could produce our own animated custom chart to tell the right story for our data.Over five weeks we will explore Excel's rich selection of visualization tools using practical case studies as seen through the eyes of Rohan, an environmental analyst. Rohan is required to produce visualizations that will show trends, forecasts, breakdowns and comparisons for a large variety of environmental data sets. As well as utilising the usual chart types he wants to use conditional formats, sparklines, specialised charts and even create his own animated charts and infographics. In some cases, he will also need to prepare the data using pivot tables to drill down and answer very specific questions. We are going to help him achieve all this and present our finished visualizations in attractive reports and dashboards that use tools like slicers and macros for automation and interactivity.\n\nThese are the topics we will cover:\nWeek 1: \tDynamic visualizations with conditional formatting, custom number formatting, sparklines and macros\nWeek 2: \tCharting techniques for telling the right story\nWeek 3: \tCreating specialised and custom charts\nWeek 4: \tSummarising and filtering data with pivot tables and pivot charts\nWeek 5: \tCreating interactive dashboards in Excel\n\nThis is the second course in our Specialization on Data Analytics and Visualization. The first course: Excel Fundamentals for Data Analysis, covers data preparation and cleaning but also teaches some of the prerequisites for this course like tables and named ranges as well as text, lookup and logical functions. To get the most out of this course we would recommend you do the first course or have experience with these topics. In this course we focus on Data Visualization in Excel, join us for this exciting journey.",

It’s easy to make the mistake of assuming that the functionality of a database will take shape over time, or the design will fall into place as you build the database.This course introduces a process for effectively planning and designing a functional, efficient database. Knowing how to plan a relational database is important to the success of the databases you create. Without planning, you cannot possibly know what the database needs to do, or even what information to include in the database. Planning a database is essential and prevents the extra work of fixing data maintenance problems later on.\n\nThe concepts are not specific to a particular software application and can be applied to any relational database management system.\n\nThis course is designed for students who need to learn database design essentials, typically in preparation for, or as a supplement to, a course on SQL such as Logical Operations' SQL Querying: Fundamentals and courses on specific relational database platforms.\n\nIn this course, you will: follow an efficient process for designing a relational database; define the database conceptual model; define the database logical model; apply database normalization methods to improve the initial design of a database; and complete the database design, including controls to ensure its referential integrity and data integrity.",

Upon the completion of this course, you will be able to  \n\n1. Improve the forecasting accuracy by building and validating demand prediction models. \n2. Better stimulate and influence demand by identifying the drivers (e.g., time, seasonality, price, and other environmental factors) for demand and quantifying their impact.\n\nAK is a leading cookware manufacturer in North America. Its newly launched top-line product was gaining momentum in the marketplace. However, a price adjustment at the peak season stimulated a significant demand surge which took AK completely by surprise and resulted in huge backorders. AK faced the risk of losing the market momentum due to the upset customers and the high cost associated with over-time production and expedited shipping. Accurate demand forecast is essential for increasing revenue and reducing cost. Identifying the drivers for demand and assessing their impact on demand can help companies better influence and stimulate demand.\n\nI hope you enjoy the course!",

Words and pictures—the building blocks of graphic design—are the elements that carry the majority of the content in both the digital world and the printed world. As graphic design becomes more visible and prevalent in our lives, graphic design as a practice becomes more important in our culture.Through visual examples, this course will teach you the fundamental principles of graphic design: imagemaking, typography, composition, working with color and shape... foundational skills that are common in all areas of graphic design practice. I don't just want you to watch a video of someone talking about design, I want you to MAKE design! If you want to be a designer you have to be a maker and a communicator, so this course will offer you lots of opportunities to get your hands dirty with exercises and with more practical projects.\n\nAt the end of this course you will have learned how to explore and investigate visual representation through a range of image-making techniques; understand basic principles of working with shape, color and pattern; been exposed to the language and skills of typography; and understand and have applied the principles of composition and visual contrast. If you complete the course, along with its optional (but highly recommended) briefs, you will have a core set of graphic design skills that you can apply to your own projects, or to more deeply investigate a specialized area of graphic design.\n\nTo succeed in this course you will need access to a computer. You can complete this course without one but it will be tougher. Access to, and a beginner's level knowledge of Adobe Creative Suite programs, such as Illustrator, Photoshop and InDesign will help you, especially if you want to complete the optional briefs.",

Moreover, traditional asset management practices fail to recognize information as an asset to be managed with earnest discipline. This has led to a business culture of complacence, and the inability for most organizations to fully leverage available information assets.This second course in the two-part Infonomics series explores how and why to adapt well-honed asset management principles and practices to information, and how to apply accepted and new valuation models to gauge information’s potential and realized economic benefits. In addition, the course will enlighten students on the critical but confounding issues of information ownership, property rights, and sovereignty. The course will wrap up with an overview of emergent roles for the information-savvy organization of the 21st century.",

This figure represents about 3.5% of the annual World GDP from 2007 to 2030.\n\nThe European Commission estimated, that by 2020, Europe will need between 1.5 - 2 trillion Euros in infrastructure investments. Between 2011 and 2020, about 500 billion Euros will be required for the implementation of the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T) program, 400 billion Euros for Energy distribution networks and smart grids, 200 billion Euros on Energy transmission networks and storage, and 500 billion Euros for the upgrade and construction of new power plants. An additional 38 - 58 billion Euros and 181 - 268 billion Euros in capital investment will be needed to achieve the targets set by the European Commission for broadband diffusion.\n\nTraditionally investments in infrastructure were financed using public sources. However, severe budget constraints and inefficient management of infrastructure by public entities have led to an increased involvement of private investors in the business. \n\nThe course focuses on how private investors approach infrastructure projects from the standpoint of equity, debt, and hybrid instruments. \n\nThe course concentrates on the practical aspects of project finance: the most frequently used financial techniques for infrastructure investments. The repeated use of real life examples and case studies will allow students to link the theoretical background to actual business practices.\n\nIn the end of the course, students will be capable of analyzing a complex transaction, identifying the key elements of a deal, and suggesting proper solutions for deal structuring from a financial advisor's perspective.\n\nCourse Format\nThe course will consist of lecture videos, readings, and talks given by guest speakers. Although we do hope you will attend the entire course, it is possible to just focus on single topics.\n\nSuggested Readings\nThe course is designed to be self-contained, there are no obligatory readings that must be acquired outside of the course. \nFor students interested in additional study material, you may refer to:\n•\tGatti Stefano, \"Project Finance in theory and practice\", Academic Press, 2nd edition, 2012.",

In this intermediate-level course, you’ll learn how to evaluate investment opportunities using core financial modeling and risk management techniques. You’ll start by building a simple three-year cash-flow model to calculate key metrics like IRR, NPV, and payback period, and to identify the assumptions that drive value. Then, you’ll shift to the other side of the equation—analyzing how market, operational, and regulatory risks can alter returns and shape deal outcomes. Through short videos, concise readings, and realistic hands-on exercises, you’ll practice thinking like a corporate analyst: modeling uncertainty, testing assumptions, and presenting results with confidence. By the end, you’ll be able to build and interpret financial models that stand up to scrutiny and communicate a deal’s true potential—skills that matter in every investment, budgeting, or strategic finance role.",

We’ll learn about how the brain uses two very different learning modes and how it encapsulates (“chunks”) information. We’ll also cover illusions of learning, memory techniques, dealing with procrastination, and best practices shown by research to be most effective in helping you master tough subjects.Using these approaches, no matter what your skill levels in topics you would like to master, you can change your thinking and change your life. If you’re already an expert, this peep under the mental hood will give you ideas for turbocharging successful learning, including counter-intuitive test-taking tips and insights that will help you make the best use of your time on homework and problem sets. If you’re struggling, you’ll see a structured treasure trove of practical techniques that walk you through what you need to do to get on track. If you’ve ever wanted to become better at anything, this course will help serve as your guide.\n\nThis course can be taken independent of, concurrent with, or prior to, its companion course, Mindshift.

Simply put: by incorporating sustainability and social impact factors on people and planet into management decisions. Through this course, anyone can learn to improve their organization's practice of impact measurement and management and align their ESG or impact activities and reporting with emerging global standards.Impact Measurement and Management for the SDGs is a collaboration between UNDP SDG Impact and the award-winning team at CASE at Duke University.  The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) is a steward of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that were launched in 2015 and to which 193 countries have signed up to achieve by 2030. The SDGs are a shared plan to end extreme poverty, reduce inequality, and protect the planet; they have become the world’s blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all. \n\nBut the public sector cannot meet those goals alone. Climate change, poverty, racial and gender equity, food, health, education, clean water − the list of challenges faced by people and planet is too long. Businesses and investors have stepped in to help. The course was designed around the fundamental elements of the SDG Impact Standards, the only management standards that embed sustainability at the core of an organization in the holistic way intended by the creators of the SDGs. The course demonstrates how the SDG Impact Standards help organizations align with responsible business principles, other standards, and best practices in impact management. \n\nIn the course, you’ll learn to improve decision-making for positive impact on people and planet in line with the SDG Impact Standards and the Operating Principles for Impact Management. In the course, we have translated 4 universal practices of impact management into practical actions: SET STRATEGY, INTEGRATE, OPTIMIZE and REINFORCE. We teach the steps to implement these actions through short videos and lessons with concrete practical examples.\n\nProfessionals who know how to apply these sustainable management standards are increasingly in demand by institutions globally as they work to improve their performance and reporting around ESG and impact management. If you work or wish to work within an enterprise, a corporation, a fund that manages assets or an asset owner or advisory that oversees investment assets, or if you just want to learn more about impact investing, ESG, social finance or corporate reporting, this course will help you master the core concepts and practices in impact management for the SDGs and other impacts from enterprise and investor perspectives.\n\nThis course was written and is delivered by CASE Faculty Director Cathy Clark, and benefitted from extensive input from a larger team from UNDP, CASE, global academic advisors, and other experts.

          "description": "The no-code revolution has democratized creation, empowering entrepreneurs, citizen developers, and business innovators to build sophisticated applications without writing a single line of code. You’ve experienced this power firsthand. You’ve dragged, dropped, and configured your way to a functional app—a new SaaS tool, an internal dashboard, or an e-commerce storefront. It works. The logic flows, the database is populated, and you’re ready to launch. But then, the real world intervenes. A user reports that the checkout button is broken, but you can’t reproduce the error. Beta testers find the onboarding process “confusing,” but their feedback is vague. A critical workflow fails silently, and you only discover it hours later after digging through logs. This is the no-code \"glass ceiling\"—the frustrating gap between building something that functions and engineering something that is flawless, reliable, and user-delighting.Welcome to \"Debug and Perfect Your No-Code Apps,\" the essential intermediate-level course designed to shatter that ceiling. This is not another tutorial on how to build; this is a masterclass on how to perfect. This course provides the systematic methodologies and professional-grade tools you need to diagnose, resolve, and refine your applications with the precision of a seasoned software developer. You will move beyond guesswork and frantic clicking, and learn to systematically hunt down the root cause of any issue, transform ambiguous user feedback into brilliant UI improvements, and ultimately deliver applications that are not just functional, but truly exceptional.\n\nThis course is explicitly designed for:\n\nThe Ambitious No-Code Founder/Entrepreneur: You've built your MVP and are ready for real users and paying customers. You cannot afford to have your growth derailed by bugs or a confusing user experience. This course will give you the quality assurance framework to launch with confidence and iterate effectively, ensuring your product is stable, professional, and ready to scale.\nThe Citizen Developer or Business Technologist: You build applications and automations to solve problems within your organization. Your colleagues depend on your tools to do their jobs. You will learn how to rigorously test your solutions, ensuring they are robust and error-free, thereby increasing user adoption and solidifying your reputation as a reliable problem-solver.\n\nThe Aspiring No-Code Professional: You are looking to build a career as a freelance no-code developer or join an agency. Your clients will expect more than just a functional app; they will expect a polished, bug-free product. This course will equip you with the debugging and user-centric refinement skills that separate amateurs from highly sought-after professionals, allowing you to command higher rates and deliver superior results.\n\nThe UI/UX Designer Who Builds: You have a keen eye for design and user flows, and you use no-code platforms to create high-fidelity prototypes or full applications. You will learn how to technically validate your designs, conduct effective usability tests, and translate qualitative feedback into concrete, data-driven improvements, closing the loop between design vision and real-world implementation.\nThe primary goal of this course is to empower you with a professional-grade quality assurance mindset, enabling you to systematically enhance the operational stability and user experience of any no-code application. We aim to equip you with the skills to not only fix what is broken but to perfect what is merely adequate.\n\nTo achieve this, the course is structured around two interconnected aims:\n\n1. Aim: To Master Systematic Functional Debugging and Root Cause Analysis. The first half of this course is a deep dive into the science of finding and fixing bugs. You will learn to think like a detective, moving from a high-level user complaint to the specific, underlying cause. We will deconstruct a real-world e-commerce disaster scenario: a failed checkout flow. You will learn to trace the user’s journey step-by-step, using professional tools like Chrome DevTools to inspect front-end activity, monitor network requests, and analyze console errors. You’ll then pivot to the backend, using platform-specific tools like Bubble's debugger to trace data flows and execution logic. You will learn to identify the tell-tale signs of a problem, such as a \"400 Bad Request\" response from a payment API, and methodically isolate the root cause—in this case, an incorrect request header. This aim is intensely practical, ensuring you leave with a repeatable framework for functional and integration testing that applies to any no-code platform.\n2. Aim: To Master User-Centric Refinement Through Empirical Feedback. A bug-free app that users can't figure out is still a failed app. The second aim of this course is to teach you how to systematically improve your application’s usability. You will learn to move beyond your own assumptions and gather objective, actionable insights directly from your users. We will explore how to design and run effective usability tests with a small group of beta users, providing you with scripts and templates for both moderated and unmoderated sessions. You will learn to do more than just collect feedback; you will learn to analyze it, cataloging friction points, identifying recurring patterns of confusion, and synthesizing your findings into a clear, prioritized list of improvements. Drawing on case studies like Convertica's e-commerce optimizations, you will practice translating these insights into tangible changes—revising confusing button labels, adding clarifying tooltips, and redesigning entire layouts to measurably improve task-success scores and overall user satisfaction.\n\nWhere to Go From Here: Continuing Your Learning Journey\n\n\"Debug and Perfect Your No-Code Apps\" provides you with a powerful set of specialized skills. To continue your growth and become an even more well-rounded product builder, we recommend exploring these complementary learning paths on Coursera:\n\nFor a Deeper Foundation in User Experience: If you discovered a passion for user-centric design, the Google UX Design Professional Certificate is the perfect next step. It will provide a comprehensive, industry-recognized foundation in UX principles, from user research and ideation to wireframing and high-fidelity prototyping, making your refinement process even more effective.\n\nFor Aspiring Product Leaders: The ability to debug and refine an application is a core competency for product management. To build on this, consider the Google Project Management: Professional Certificate. It will teach you the methodologies (like Agile) to manage the entire product lifecycle, from initial planning and resource allocation to launch and iteration, providing a strategic framework for the tactical skills you've just mastered.\n\nFor Understanding the \"Code\" Behind No-Code: As you debug, you will encounter concepts like APIs, JSON, and HTTP requests. To demystify these and gain even more power, a foundational course like \"Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python)\" from the University of Michigan can be transformative. Understanding the basics of code will make you a vastly more effective no-code developer, especially when integrating with third-party services.\n\nYour learning journey will be intensely hands-on, culminating in the creation of a No-Code Application Debugging Toolkit—a professional portfolio piece that documents your process of analyzing a user journey, identifying defects, resolving them with technical tools, and refining the UI based on user feedback. You will emerge from this course with the skills, the tools, and the confidence to build and maintain truly high-quality, user-centered, and resilient no-code applications.",

          "description": "Quality has been a thorny issue for the software development industry. From early programs to modern applications, software has always been prone to bugs- defects that shouldn’t be there yet often make their way into production, diminishing user experience and frustrating developers. Ensuring that the final product works as expected is the core responsibility of QA practices and processes. However, this is easier said than done. The QA function is often misunderstood and forgotten, especially in agile environment where principles like “progress over perfection” and “fail fast to learn fast” made practitioners shift their focus away from thoughtful quality management.Managing quality is not about eliminating every bug and issue. It may not even be possible. Instead, it’s about building software development processes that are able to deliver the expected results which the team commits to. Predictability, as a key measure of quality, allows teams to adjust their throughput by consciously deciding on the acceptable quality levels for their final products.  \n\nIn this course, we will explore how to design and structure an effective quality process in the modern agile team through collaboration and automation. We will look at tools and techniques that work; and combine them with meaningful measures, which will allow us not only position QA function appropriately within the agile delivery process but also improve and fine-tune it over time \n\nThis course is designed for professionals involved in ensuring software quality within agile environments. It is ideal for software testers, quality engineers, developers, scrum masters, agile coaches, and team managers who are engaged in or responsible for agile development processes. Whether you’re directly testing code or guiding agile delivery practices, this course equips you with the tools and strategies to elevate quality assurance in your team.\n\nTo fully benefit from this course, learners should have a foundational understanding of the software development lifecycle, software testing principles, and agile methodologies. Prior exposure to agile project environments will help contextualize the QA concepts presented and allow for easier application of best practices in real-world scenarios.\n\nBy the end of the course, learners will be able to clearly define the role of QA in agile development and integrate quality practices from the earliest stages of the software lifecycle. They’ll learn to scope effective automation strategies and use data insights to continuously refine the QA process. These skills will help teams deliver higher-quality software with greater predictability and alignment to user expectations.",

          "description": "Process mining is the missing link between model-based process analysis and data-oriented analysis techniques. Through concrete data sets and easy to use software the course provides data science knowledge that can be applied directly to analyze and improve processes in a variety of domains.Data science is the profession of the future, because organizations that are unable to use (big) data in a smart way will not survive. It is not sufficient to focus on data storage and data analysis. The data scientist also needs to relate data to process analysis. Process mining bridges the gap between traditional model-based process analysis (e.g., simulation and other business process management techniques) and data-centric analysis techniques such as machine learning and data mining. Process mining seeks the confrontation between event data (i.e., observed behavior) and process models (hand-made or discovered automatically). This technology has become available only recently, but it can be applied to any type of operational processes (organizations and systems). Example applications include: analyzing treatment processes in hospitals, improving customer service processes in a multinational, understanding the browsing behavior of customers using booking site, analyzing failures of a baggage handling system, and improving the user interface of an X-ray machine. All of these applications have in common that dynamic behavior needs to be related to process models. Hence, we refer to this as \"data science in action\".\n\nThe course explains the key analysis techniques in process mining. Participants will learn various process discovery algorithms. These can be used to automatically learn process models from raw event data. Various other process analysis techniques that use event data will be presented. Moreover, the course will provide easy-to-use software, real-life data sets, and practical skills to directly apply the theory in a variety of application domains.\n\nThis course starts with an overview of approaches and technologies that use event data to support decision making and business process (re)design. Then the course focuses on process mining as a bridge between data mining and business process modeling. The course is at an introductory level with various practical assignments.\n\nThe course covers the three main types of process mining.\n\n1. The first type of process mining is discovery. A discovery technique takes an event log and produces a process model without using any a-priori information. An example is the Alpha-algorithm that takes an event log and produces a process model (a Petri net) explaining the behavior recorded in the log.\n\n2. The second type of process mining is conformance. Here, an existing process model is compared with an event log of the same process. Conformance checking can be used to check if reality, as recorded in the log, conforms to the model and vice versa.\n\n3. The third type of process mining is enhancement. Here, the idea is to extend or improve an existing process model using information about the actual process recorded in some event log. Whereas conformance checking measures the alignment between model and reality, this third type of process mining aims at changing or extending the a-priori model. An example is the extension of a process model with performance information, e.g., showing bottlenecks. Process mining techniques can be used in an offline, but also online setting. The latter is known as operational support. An example is the detection of non-conformance at the moment the deviation actually takes place. Another example is time prediction for running cases, i.e., given a partially executed case the remaining processing time is estimated based on historic information of similar cases.\n\nProcess mining provides not only a bridge between data mining and business process management; it also helps to address the classical divide between \"business\" and \"IT\". Evidence-based business process management based on process mining helps to create a common ground for business process improvement and information systems development.\n\nThe course uses many examples using real-life event logs to illustrate the concepts and algorithms. After taking this course, one is able to run process mining projects and have a good understanding of the Business Process Intelligence field.\n\nAfter taking this course you should:\n- have a good understanding of Business Process Intelligence techniques (in particular process mining),\n- understand the role of Big Data in today’s society,\n- be able to relate process mining techniques to other analysis techniques such as simulation, business intelligence, data mining, machine learning, and verification,\n- be able to apply basic process discovery techniques to learn a process model from an event log (both manually and using tools),\n- be able to apply basic conformance checking techniques to compare event logs and process models (both manually and using tools),\n- be able to extend a process model with information extracted from the event log (e.g., show bottlenecks),\n- have a good understanding of the data needed to start a process mining project,\n- be able to characterize the questions that can be answered based on such event data,\n- explain how process mining can also be used for operational support (prediction and recommendation), and\n- be able to conduct process mining projects in a structured manner.",

Even the most advanced multi-user wireless networks ultimately rely on the same fundamental building block: a reliable link between a transmitter and a receiver.In this course, you’ll explore some aspects of how that link works and why understanding it is essential in today’s interconnected world. Starting with the simplest one-way wireless system, you’ll learn how information is encoded, modulated, transmitted, and recovered over radio waves. Along the way, you’ll uncover the core techniques—analog and digital modulation, filtering, error control, and frequency-division strategies—that underpin modern technologies such as satellite communications, 5G infrastructure, scientific telemetry, and emerging wireless broadband solutions.\nBy the end of the course, you’ll not only understand how a point-to-point link operates but also why these principles continue to drive innovation across the wireless ecosystem. This foundation will build upon and prepare you for other courses in the series and give you insight into the engineering decisions shaping today’s most critical communication systems.",

If you do not consider all of the flows, you will miss opportunities or sub-optimize parts of the supply chain.The second of five courses in this specialization will focus on Sourcing Excellence. You will learn how the inbound flow of products, information, and finances into the company facilitates the supply chain. It will consist of four modules, which will cover the following topics: core sourcing elements; inbound information flow;  supply chain financing; and finally the capstone case study.\nYou will have lectures, readings, and discussions with your peers for each topic, as well as a practice quiz in each lesson. At the end of each module, you can put your knowledge to the test and take a graded quiz. The Capstone Analysis module contains a real-life case analysis, as well as a supply chain management project that will enable you to be an expert on a company of your choosing.",

Through real-world case studies from organizations like Netflix and Microsoft, hands-on planning exercises, and interactive coaching experiences, you'll learn to lead change initiatives that stick because people believe in both the destination and the leader guiding them there. Whether you're implementing new technology, restructuring teams, or shifting organizational culture, this course helps you integrate effectiveness with empathy for lasting transformation success.",

This course focuses on the requirement analysis phase of SDLC, and you will learn how to use UML models to capture the system requirements and to facilitate communication between client/users and developers. UML is a general purpose visual modeling language for systems. It can be used to highlight different aspects of the system that are of interest to different stakeholders. Data requirements are captured in the domain model, which describes the important concepts of the application domain as classes, associations between them and constraints on them. Functional requirements are captured in the use-case model to describe the interactions between the system and its environment (users, other systems).UML incorporates the current best practices in Object-Oriented modeling techniques. Basic object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts are required to attempt the course. It is recommended to take the courses in the order they are listed, as they progressively develop techniques and concepts about software engineering, but it is not a hard requirement.",

The role of an entry-level UX designer might include empathizing with users, defining their pain points, coming up with ideas for design solutions, creating wireframes, prototypes, and mockups, and testing designs to get feedback.Current UX designers and researchers at Google will serve as your instructors, and you will complete hands-on activities that simulate real-world UX design scenarios. Learners who complete the courses in this certificate program should be equipped to apply for entry-level jobs as UX designers. No previous experience is necessary.\n\nBy the end of this course, you will be able to: \n   - Define the field of UX and explain why it’s important for consumers and businesses.\n   - Understand foundational concepts in UX design, such as user-centered design, the design thinking framework, accessibility, and equity-focused design. \n   - Identify the factors that contribute to great user experience design.\n   - Review common job responsibilities of entry-level UX designers and teams that they work with.\n   - Explore job opportunities and career paths within the field of user experience.  \n   - Explain why design sprints are an important and useful part of a UX designer’s work.\n  - Describe common UX research methods. \n   - Identify and account for biases in UX research.",
