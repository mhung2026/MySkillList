# 🧩 SKILL ASSESSMENT REPORT (SFIA-BASED)

## 1. GENERAL INFORMATION

- **Candidate / Employee Name:**
- **Role / Position Evaluated:**
- **Assessment Date:**
- **Assessment Method:**
  - Forced-choice behavioral test (SFIA-based)
- **Number of Questions:**
- **Skills Assessed:**

---

## 2. ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY

This report is built upon:
- **Forced-choice questions (Situational Judgement Test)**
- Assessment of **actual behaviors**, not knowledge
- Level inference following **SFIA – Highest Consistent Behaviour Rule**

### Level Inference Principles:
- A level is considered achieved when:
  - ≥ 70% of choices demonstrate behavior at that level
  - Spread across ≥ 3 different contexts
- Final level is the **highest level meeting consistency criteria**

---

## 3. RESULTS OVERVIEW

| Skill | Inferred SFIA Level | Confidence |
|------|--------------------|------------|
| Skill 1 | Level X | High / Medium / Low |
| Skill 2 | Level X | High / Medium / Low |
| Skill 3 | Level X | High / Medium / Low |

> **Confidence** reflects the consistency of behavior across contexts.

---

#### 4.2 Behavioral Evidence

Behaviors observed throughout the test:

- …
- …
- …

Examples:

Signs indicating the next level has not been achieved:

- …
- …
- …

Examples:
- Avoids decisions when scope is unclear
- Tends to wait for confirmation in high-risk situations
- Has not demonstrated ownership of overall quality

---

#### 4.4 Analysis by SFIA Level

| Level | Evidence | Result |
|------|--------|--------|
| L1 | Behavior requires supervision | ❌ |
| L2 | Follows instructions | ✅ |
| L3 | Autonomous within scope | ✅ |
| L4 | Responsible for approach | ❌ |
